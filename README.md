# java_project
Use Eclipse(like eclipse.org)/Netbeans(like netbeans.org) Java to run this program (Title called "Sourcejav"), following screenshot is showing this program running and output text. Please install the **newest version of Java (Java 8 update 121)**, because the program only support for Java 8 update 121. Usage *quote required (**JPanel**)* is only support for Java 8 update 121, the Java 9 also support for code "JPanel a = new JPanel()" but Java 9 does not support for code "JPanel a = new JPanel("blah blah blah")". Actually, this code is not using in Java 9, so you do not install Java 9 in this reason, but also you can install Java 8 when you are using "JPanel a = new JPanel("blah blah blah")" on a line.

Alternatively, Eclipse/Netbeans can run like "killall java" to stop your program and Eclipse/Netbeans. This command when Eclipse/Netbeans GUI does not stops working,  do **not** run like "killall java" or "killall -9 java", but if Eclipse/Netbeans stops working, you need to run things like type "killall java" or "killall -9 java". The command "killall -9 java"/"killall java" to close all program written in Java, so do not do it in terminal.

If you have an problem, please post as an issue on this project (not lincongNMR/java_project). The Java support does not use Eclipse to support Java Application, so you post them as an issue if you have an error and a problem you've encountered on zixuan75/java_project. Issue do not post as you have an question on this project, please post as an comment on a pull request "Beta folder".
